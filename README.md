# Wordly Dictionary SPA

This is my summative project for Flatiron School. It's a simple single-page dictionary app that lets you search for any English word and see the definition, part of speech, an example sentence, synonyms, and pronunciation audio — all pulled from the Free Dictionary API.

## Features
- Search for any word using the input box
- See the word’s:
  - Part of speech
  - Definition
  - Example (if available)
  - Synonyms
  - Pronunciation audio (if available)
- Handles errors (like empty input or no results)
- Clean and responsive layout

## How It Works
- Uses `fetch()` to get word data from the Free Dictionary API
- DOM is updated dynamically using JavaScript
- Error messages and audio playback are handled in a user-friendly way

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Free Dictionary API
